  Earnbase Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Earnbase
  platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract
  standards.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review <a href="https://eips.earnbase.org/EIPS/eip-0">EIP-0</a>.</li>
  <li>Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.</li>
  <li>
    Add your EIP to your fork of the repository. There is a
    <a href="https://github.com/earnbasefinance/EIPs/blob/master/eip-X.md"
      >template EIP here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit a Pull Request to Earnbase's
    <a href="https://github.com/earnbasefinance/EIPs">EIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final EIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new EIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the EIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your EIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that EIP as follow:
  <code>assets/eip-X</code> (for eip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  EIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/eip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your EIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it
  can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community
  agrees to include it, the EIP editors will update the state of your EIP to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
